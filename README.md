# Operating System term project
 ### Designing and implementing a management solution that can locally monitor and control a Linux system. Following the steps given below and developing the components accordingly.
## "Proc" pseudo file system
### • Understanding what "Proc" is and what we can do with the interface.
### • Developing a Python script to capture CPU and system statistics on an interval basis:
o CPU utilization in percentage: user mode, sys mode, overall utilization 
o The number of interrupts
o The number of context switches
o The memory utilization: available memory (MB), total memory (MB), memory utilization (percentage)
### • Developing a Python script to capture Disk I/O statistics on an interval basis :
o The number of disk reads
o The number of blocks read
o The number of disk writes
o The number of blocks written
### • Developing a Python script to capture network statistics on an interval basis :
o The number of established and active TCP connections
o A list of TCP/UDP connections with username, program, source and destination
addresses
o Network utilization
### • Developing a Python script to capture, on an interval basis, statistics for top processes as well as an individual process:
o Process CPU utilization in percentage: user mode, sys mode, overall utilization o Process virtual memory utilization
o Process physical memory utilization
o User name and program name
